# fp26_hab_prediction

Template for starting Fish-PACE project repos. 

This repo is an example of how teams can structure their project repositories and format their project README.md file, but feel free to adapt as suits your needs.

**Folder Structure**

* `contributor_folders` (optional) Each contributor can make a folder here and 
push their work here during the week. This will allow everyone to see each others work but prevent any merge conflicts.
* `final_notebooks` When the team develops shared final notebooks, they 
can be shared here. Make sure to communicate so that you limit merge conflicts.
* `scripts` Shared scripts or functions can be added here.
* `data` Shared dataset can be shared here. Note, do not put large datasets on GitHub. Speak to the organizers if you 
need to share large datasets.
